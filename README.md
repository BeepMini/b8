# BeepMini Retro Game Engine

[BeepMini](https://beepmini.com/) is a tiny JavaScript game engine for creating retro-style games in the browser.
It's inspired by 8-bit computers of the 1980s, but built with modern web tech.

BeepMini is not an emulator or a locked-down fantasy console. It's a lightweight JavaScript library that gives you the tools of a retro engine while keeping the freedom of the open web.

✅ Open source
✅ Runs in any browser
✅ Simple API
✅ No external plugins or assets required

## Getting Started

Download the files in `dist` and `assets` - these are all you need to run BeepMini.

```html
<script src="dist/b8.js"></script>
<script>
	b8.init();
	// your game code here
</script>
```

To develop BeepMini locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # builds dist/b8.js and watches for changes
npm run build # builds everything for release
```

## Why is the code prefixed with b8?

To avoid polluting the global namespace, all BeepMini code lives inside a single global object called `b8`. For example, instead of calling `init()`, you call `b8.init()`. This prevents BeepMini's functions and variables from clashing with other libraries or your own code.

The name `b8` was chosen because *BeepMini* starts with "B" and has 8 letters. It's also short and easy to remember.

Originally, the project was called *Beep8*, but another project later used that name. Rather than cause confusion (and since I already owned several domains), I renamed it *BeepMini*. The `b8` prefix remains as a nod to the original name.
