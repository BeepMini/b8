# Beep8 Retro Game Engine

[Beep8](https://beep8.com/) is a tiny JavaScript game engine for creating retro-style games in the browser.
Itâ€™s inspired by 8-bit computers of the 1980s, but built with modern web tech.

Beep8 is not an emulator or a locked-down fantasy console. Itâ€™s a lightweight JavaScript library that gives you the tools of a retro engine while keeping the freedom of the open web.

âœ… Open source
âœ… Runs in any browser
âœ… Simple API
âœ… No external plugins or assets required
