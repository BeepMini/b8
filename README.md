# beep8

BEEP8 is a tiny Javascript engine that lets you create games and experiences inspired by the look and feel of a retro 80s computer. It's not an emulator or a fantasy console: it's just a Javascript library. It's free and open source.

## Inspired by QX82

beep8 is a fork of the QX82 engine by [btco](https://github.com/btco/qx82). For more information, check out the [QX82 site](https://btco.github.io/qx82).
