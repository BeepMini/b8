# beep8

BEEP8 is a tiny Javascript engine that lets you create games and experiences inspired by the look and feel of a retro 80s computer. It's not an emulator or a fantasy console: it's just a Javascript library. It's free and open source.

## Getting Started

The files in dist are the only files you need to run beep8. You will also need the assets directory.

To develop locally you can run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. This will run a watch script that will rebuild the dist/beep8.js file. To build everything run `npm run build`.
